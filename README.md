# leaflet-map-polygon-hover
Leaflet thematic polygon (choropleth) map, with hover info window, using GeoJSON data

## Demo
- https://yuccafrita.github.io/leaflet-map-polygon-hover/
- http://jackdougherty.github.io/leaflet-map-polygon-hover/index.html

## Benefits
- This GeoJSON version is simpler for novices to understand, since they can create and join GeoJSON data file in MapShaper.org
- Works in iOS and Android mobile devices

## Compare with
- Standard LeafletJS choropleth tutorial http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html (which draws data from .js file with declared variable, and does not work on mobile devices), and similar version http://github.com/jackdougherty/leaflet-map-polygon-hover-from-js/index.html

####General overview of steps below
- Join a GeoJSON polygon map with spreadsheet data
- Modify color ranges and info box text & variables as needed
- Upload all files to a forked or new GitHub repository, create GitHub pages branch for live web host

####Detailed steps:
- Start with GeoJSON polygon map with no numerical data, such as: ct-towns-borders.geojson
- Import polygon map into http://MapShaper.org. Simplify to reduce size as needed.
- Export as CSV to create spreadsheet of polygon names. In this example, column header is "town"
- Open CSV with any spreadsheet tool. Insert columns of data into the CSV sheet. Use VLOOKUP function if needed.
- Save CSV with new name: ct-towns.csv
- Import ct-towns.csv as second layer into MapShaper.org.
- Use the drop-down to select the polygon map (ct-towns-borders.geojson) as the active, displayed layer.
- Click the Console and enter command to join the CSV table to the GeoJSON polygon
  ```
  -join ct-towns.csv keys=town,town
  ```
- Export the newly joined map with a new filename in GeoJSON format: ct-towns-density.json)
- Change the file name suffix from .json to .geojson to avoid confusion
- Fork this GitHub repository, or create your own, with these files (or equivalent):
  - index.html
  - script.js
  - style.css
  - ct-towns-density.geojson  (the data file)

- in index.html, adjust the reference to the data file
- in script.js, adjust the hover info box text and references as needed
- in script.js, Adjust the ranges with http://colorbrewer.org
